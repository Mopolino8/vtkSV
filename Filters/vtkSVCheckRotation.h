/** @file vtkSVCheckRotation.h
 *  @brief This is a vtk filter to map a triangulated surface to a sphere.
 *  @details This filter uses the heat flow method to map a triangulated
 *  surface to a sphere. The first step is to compute the Tutte Energy, and
 *  the second step is to perform the conformal map. For more details, see
 *  Gu et al., Genus Zero Surface Conformal Mapping and Its
 *  Application to Brain Surface Mapping, 2004.
